// Time Complexity - A single pass over DLL takes O(N) time.
// Space Complexity - Since we do not use any extra space, space complexity is O(1).
// Explanation - First study this problem: https://github.com/Arya-Gupta/450DSA/tree/main/Linked%20List/Reverse%20a%20linked%20list 
As we iterate through the DLL, we reverse the links similar to the way we would have done it in case of a singly LL.
We use nextNode to SWAP the next and prev pointers of each node.

Node* reverseDLL(Node * head)
{
    Node* prevNode = NULL, *currNode = head, *nextNode;
    while(cur != NULL){
        nextNode = currNode->next; // Temporarily stores the next node in the DLL
        currNode->next = prevNode; // Swap
        currNode->prev = nextNode; // Swap
        prevNode = currNode; 
        currNode = nextNode;
    }
    return prevNode;
}

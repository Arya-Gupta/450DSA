// Time Complexity - Since the numbers are 32 bit, performing binary search from the the minimum number (start) upto the maximum number (end) will take log(2^32) base 2 = 32.
The upper_bound function takes O(C) time because it runs for each row which is of size C - and it runs R number of times.
Thus the total time complexity is O(32 * R * logC) = O(RlogC).
// Space Complexity - Space taken is O(1).
// Explanation - Median of an array is given by the middle element of an array. 
Another way of finding the median is that it will have N / 2 elements less than or equal to itself.
We consider elements equal to itself because repetitions may occur.

For example, 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7
The median of this array can only be 5 if we consider that there are 7 / 2 = 3 elements lesser than OR EQUAL it.
If we had only considered the elements lesser than it, the median would have been 6.

Since our matrix is only row wise sorted and not fully sorted, we cannot directly perform binary search on it.
However, we can get the start = minimum and  end = maximum elements in the matrix and perform binary search on those elements.
Since we already know the size of the array = R * C = odd number, we can say that our median element will have target = (R * C + 1) / 2 elements less than or equal to it.
To find the number of elements less than or equal to a certain element, we use the findCount function.

Now we perform a binary search from start to end to search for such an element with target elements less than or equal to it.
In case our current mid has less than target values less than it, we search from mid + 1 to end.
In case we come across an element with >= target values less than it, we still keep searching from start to mid - in case there is a SMALLER number that can also satisfy this condition.
We use end = mid and not end = mid - 1 because the mid may be our median and we not find any suitable number smaller than it.
Also, we use start < end instead of start <= end to avoid an infinite loop.

class Solution{   
public:
    int findCount(vector<vector<int>> matrix, int R, int C, int mid){
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < R; i++){
            count += upper_bound(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end(), mid) - matrix[i].begin();
        }
        return count;
    }

    int median(vector<vector<int>> &matrix, int R, int C){
        int start = INT_MAX, end = INT_MIN, mid;
        
        for(auto arr : matrix){
            start = min(start, arr[0]); // minimum value in matrix
            end = max(end, arr[C - 1]); // maximum value in matrix
        }
        
        int target = (R * C + 1) / 2;
        while(start < end){
            mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if(findCount(matrix, R, C, mid) < target) start = mid + 1;
            else end = mid;
        }
        return start;
    }
};
